An example of the config.properties file referenced in this document can be found on the msc folder

I. Starting and stopping an Imgraph data server
===============================================
To start a data server, execute the following command on the target directory of the imgraph-core maven project
	java -jar imgraph-core-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar START_NODE config.properties
where config.properties is a valid configuration file for Imgraph

Optionally you could start a data server with the basic console, to do this execute the following command: 
	java -jar imgraph-core-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar START_CONSOLE config.properties
	
To stop the server, from the same directory used to start the server execute the followin command
	java -jar imgraph-core-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar STOP_NODE
	
II. Starting ans stopping of an Imgraph traversal manager server
====================================================
To start a data server, execute the following command on the target directory of the imgraph-core maven project
	java -jar imgraph-core-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar START_MANAGER config.properties
where config.properties is a valid configuration file for Imgraph

To stop the server, from the same directory used to start the server execute the followin command
	java -jar imgraph-core-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar STOP_MANAGER
	
III. Starting of the Gremlin console
====================================
From the main Gremlin directory execute the follwing command
	./bin/gremlin.sh

Then, the Gremlin console will be started. Before executing the Gremlin commands or scripts you have to start the Imgraph 
data server inside the Gremlin console by executing the following command:
	ImgraphFactory.startImgraphEngine()

This will start the Infinispan Cache and the ZeroMQ server. Then, when the other data servers of the cluster have been completely initialized, execute
the following command to configure the cluster
	ImgraphFactory.configureCluster()

Finally to obtain a reference to the object implementing the Blueprints interface Graph, execute the following command:
	g = ImgraphGraph.getInstance()

Then, you can use g to execute the Gremlin commands that you want, more documentation about Gremlin commands can be found on 
https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki

If you want to exit the Gremlin console you must shutdown first the Imgraph data server using the following command:
	ImgraphFactory.stopImgraphEngine()


IV. Starting and stopping the Rexster server
==================================
From the Rexster main directory execute the following commands:

	cd rexster-server/target/rexster-server-2.5.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone
	./bin/rexster.sh --start

This will start the Rexster server on the local machine, during the startup the an Imgraph data server will be started automatically; however,
the cluster will not be configured automatically so it's advisable to do it using the following command:
	com.tinkerpop.blueprints.impls.imgraph.ImgraphFactory.configureCluster()

You can notice in the previous command that the ImgraphFactory class was specified including the complete package name. When you're using Rexster, any class
does not belong to the standarad Blueprints interfaces must be specified with its complete name. This applies for example for the ImgraphFactory, ImgraphBAtchLoader
or ImgraphTraversal clasess (all belong to the package com.tinkerpop.blueprints.impls.imgraph)

Then, you can interact with the Rexster server through the rexster-console, REST API or the Dog House Web interface. For more information, 
check the documentation at https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/wiki.

As with the Gremlin console before stopping the Rexster server you must execute the Gremlin command:
	com.tinkerpop.blueprints.impls.imgraph.ImgraphFactory.startImgraphEngine()

Then to stop the server, from the same directory used to start the server execute the following command:
	./bin/rexster.sh --stop
